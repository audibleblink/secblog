      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re on a pentesting engagement and you&amp;rsquo;ve discovered a dual homed machine that allows you access to a subnet you can&amp;rsquo;t access directly from your attack machine. Assuming you&amp;rsquo;ve compromised at least one machine on the initial network, you can use it as a proxy to other machines on the &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo; subnet.
The ssh client has an often-overlooked configuration file that resides in your ~/.ssh folder. You can configure things in here that are specific to certain hosts or you can set default configurations for every host.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, work sent me to a security class for an upcoming product. While there, I learned about vulnhub, a repository of intentionally vulnerable virtual machines for anyone to compromise. Since coming back, vulnhub has become my new obsession. Here&amp;rsquo;s a walkthrough of my attempt.
Note: I struggled a bit more that this writeup lets on. The struggle is ommited for clarity and brevity.
